Advanced Forms Processors adds form processors to the Advanced Forms plugin.

== Description ==

Advanced Custom Fields is a fantastic addition to the already powerful Wordpress CMS platform.  With Advanced forms, the creation of forms based on ACF fields becomes easy.  This plugin addes form 'processors' to Advanced Forms, thus further enabling the capabilities of Advanced Forms.  Form processors serve in a manner similar to that of 'action hooks' and execute actions prior or to following form submission.

* FREE! :D
